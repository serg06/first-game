To start programming:

	From scratch:

		* Change to 64-bit project using http://stackoverflow.com/a/4364020

		* Download GLFW 64-bit src & build with cmake 64-bit
		* Download GLEW 64-bit

		* Copy glfw/include/glfw folder to projectdir/include/
		* Copy glew/include/gl folder to projectdir/include/
		* Add include directory projectdir/include

		* Copy glfw/build/src/Debug/glfw?.lib to projectdir/lib/
		* Copy glew/?/x64/glfw?.lib to projectdir/lib/
		* Add library directory projectdir/lib

		* Add .lib file names to linker/input in vc++ projec settings (including opengl32.lib if ur on windowz)
		* Add glew dll to game.exe folder

		To init glfw and glew:
			* Init glfw
			* Create glfw window
			* Init glew
				* Do not fucking set glew to GLEW_STATIC because that messes up some fucking shit

	From existing project:
		
		* Add glew dll to game.exe folder.
		
		That's all! Should be good! Unless it can't find include/lib shit, then:
			* Project -> properties -> VC++ directories -> include directories -> add the correct include directory
			* Same for lib directories -> add correct lib directory
