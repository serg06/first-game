I want to understand how 3D graphics work.

To accomplish this, I'm following this tutorial: http://learnopengl.com/
Every useful line of code in my project is likely grabbed from there, however it's formatted in my own way. 

Never coded C++ but just coming off of Java/Ruby/C so the style will be a mess of those three.
